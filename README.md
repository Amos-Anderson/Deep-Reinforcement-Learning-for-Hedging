Implemented a deep reinforcement learning framework for hedging derivatives under market frictions using neural networks, replicating key results from Buehler et al. (2019); trained TensorFlow models to minimize CVaR and utility-based risk measures under the Heston model, demonstrating scalability to high-dimensional portfolios and outperforming classical delta hedging in tail-risk scenarios.
